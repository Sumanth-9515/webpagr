            <h3>Preparation</h3>
            <p>First, basmati rice is washed, soaked, and partially cooked with whole spices like bay leaves, cloves, and cardamom to infuse it with a subtle fragrance. Meanwhile, the meat (chicken, mutton, or vegetables for a vegetarian version) is marinated with yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, and a blend of spices such as turmeric, red chili powder, and biryani masala. Onions are thinly sliced and fried unti
                l golden brown, with half set aside for layering. The marinated meat is then cooked with tomatoes, fresh mint, coriander leaves, and green chilies until tender. In a heavy-bottomed pot, the partially cooked rice and the meat mixture are layered, starting and ending with rice. Each layer is sprinkled with the reserved fried onions, fresh herbs, and saffron milk for color and aroma. The pot is then sealed and cooked on low heat (dum cooking) to allow the flavors to meld together. After cooking, the biryani is gently mixed and served hot, often accompanied by raita or salad, showcasing a harmonious blend of spices, textures, and rich flavors.</p>

<h3>Tips</h3>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>Quality Ingredients: Use high-quality basmati rice and fresh spices for the best flavor and aroma. Fresh meat or vegetables also make a big difference</li>
        <li>Rice Preparation: Wash the rice thoroughly until the water runs clear to remove excess starch. Soak it for at least 30 minutes before cooking to ensure even cooking</li>
        <li>Spice Balance: Use whole spices for cooking the rice and ground spices for marinating the meat and preparing the gravy. This balance provides a depth of flavor</li>
        <li>Marination: Marinate the meat for at least 2 hours or overnight in the refrigerator. This helps tenderize the meat and infuses it with the spices</li>
        <li>Fried Onions: Fry onions until they are golden brown and crispy. These add a rich sweetness and are crucial for the authentic biryani flavor. You can prepare these in advance.</li>
